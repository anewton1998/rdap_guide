The Internet Corporation for Names and Numbers (ICANN) has a set of [requirements for gTLD registries and registrars](https://www.icann.org/gtld-rdap-profile)
running RDAP. These requirements are broken into two parts: 1) the RDAP Technical Implementation Guide which
defines the implementation and operation of RDAP, and 2) the RDAP Response Profile which defines how gTLD registries
and registrars are to respond to RDAP queries.

The latest versions of these documents were published in February 2024 for implementation by August 2024:
* [RDAP Technical Implementation Guide](https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/rdap-technical-implementation-guide-21feb24-en.pdf)
* [RDAP Response Profile](https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/rdap-response-profile-21feb24-en.pdf)

Previous to the 2024 requirements, ICANN had the 2019 requirements:
