# Client Implementations

This section lists known, publicly available client implementations. Most are [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source).
As there is evidence that [most RDAP queries are due to automation](../misc/uses.md#who-actually-uses-rdap), it is unknown how many proprietary RDAP clients exist.

Client implementations are broken down as follows:

1. [Web Applications](web_applications.md) - those clients running inside a web browser.
1. [Mobile Applications](mobile_applications.md) - clients on mobile devices such as phones.
1. [CLI Applications](cli_applications.md) - command line interface (CLI) clients.
1. [Client Libraries](libraries.md) - software libraries incorporated into other clients.
