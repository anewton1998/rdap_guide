# Introduction

The Registry Data Access Protocol (RDAP) is the successor protocol to the Whois protocol. It was first ratified by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in March 2015 by
their Web Extensible Internet Registration Data Service (WEIRDS) working group, and initial server and client implementations were released by the many Regional Internet
Registries (RIRs) in June 2015.

In the years since RDAP became standardized, extensions have been added and profiles have been specified. While this is a clear sign of the success of the protocol,
the amount of information spread across RFCs, IANA registries and other documents makes specification information more difficult to acquire and implementations
harder to develop and deploy.

This book is intended to help developers and others involved in the deployment of RDAP clients and servers. It is not intended as a user's guide to RDAP, as such a guide
should be unnecessary if RDAP implementers are able to accomplish their goals.
