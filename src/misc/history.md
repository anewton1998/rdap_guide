# History of RDAP

The Registry Data Access Protocol (RDAP) is the successor protocol to the Whois protocol. 
It was first ratified by the [IETF](/misc/glossary.md#ietf) in March 2015 by
their [WEIRDS](/misc/glossary.md#weirds) working group, and 
initial server and client implementations were released by the American Registry for
Internet Numbers ([ARIN](https://arin.net)), the 
Latin American and Caribbean Internet Address Registry ([LACNIC](https://lacnic.net)), 
and Asia Pacific Network Information Centre ([APNIC](https://apnic.net)) in June 2015.
The following year [the RIPE NCC](https://ripe.net) deployed their service followed by
[AfriNIC](https://afrinic.net).
