# Glossary

### ccTLD

This stands for Country Code Top-Level Domain, which are [TLDs](#tld) operating on behalf of countries and consist of domains such as `.uk` but also the IDN variants.

### DNR

A Domain Name Registry is an organization responsible for the production of an authoritative DNS zone file in the public DNS. These are typically organizations running
gTLDs and ccTLDs but may also be registries below a TLD.

### EPP

The Extensible Provisioning Protocol is an [IETF](#ietf) standard used by domain registrars to register domain names into domain registries. EPP is
the required means of provisioning domains in [gTLDs](#gtld) and is used in some [ccTLDs](#cctld). EPP is used by a few [INRs](#inr) but none of the
[RIRs](#rir).

### gTLD

This stands for Generic Top-Level Domain, which is a type of [TLD](#tld) operating under contract with ICANN.

### IANA

The [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority](https://www.iana.org/) is responsible for the allocation of Autonomous System Numbers and IP addresses to the [RIRs](#rir)
from the pools of these resources created by the [IETF](#ietf), managing the root DNS zones, and managing the registries of protocol elements for the [IETF](#ietf)
and other organizations.

### IETF

The [Internet Engineering Task Force](https://ietf.org), or IETF, is one of the main standards setting organizations for Internet standards and is 
the Standards Developing Organization (SDO) which defined RDAP.

### INR

An Internet Number Registry is a registry assigning IP addresses and Autonomous System numbers (ASNs) to other organizations within a defined service area.
INRs are composed of [RIRs](#rir) but also Local Internet Registries (LIRs) and National Internet Registries (NIRs).

### jCard

jCard is the JSON version of the [vCard](#vcard) standard, which defines the details of a contact. It is standardized in [RFC 7095](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7095).

### LIR

A "Local Internet Regitry", sometimes known as an Internet Service Provider (ISP), receives number resources from another [INR](#inr) for
re-allocation to customers.

### NIR

A "National Internet Registry" is an [INR](#inr) that receives Internet number resources from an [RIR](#rir) for redistribution in a specific
country or economy.

### NRO

The [Number Resource Organization](https://www.nro.net/) is a coordination group for the [RIRs](#rir).

### RDAP 

The Registration Data Access Protocol is the name of the set of specifications for accessing data from Internet resource registries.

### REGEXT

REGEXT, or the [Registration Protocols Extensions](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/regext/documents/), working group is a long-running activity of the [IETF](#ietf) 
chartered with standardizing extensions to the [Extensible Provisioning Protocol](#epp) (EPP), RDAP, and other data formats necessary for handling 
data between Internet resource registries (e.g. RIRs, domain registries) and their
clients.

### RIR

Regional Internet Registries are the organizations receiving IP addresses and Autonomous System numbers (ASNs), collectively called Internet number resources,
from IANA and distributed to others in their respective regions. RIRs are described in [RFC 7020](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7020). 
[[WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Internet_registry)]

### TLD

A Top Level Domain is a DNS domain just below the root of the DNS, such as `.com` or `.uk`.

### WEIRDS

The [Web Extensibility Internet Registry Data Service](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/weirds/documents/) (WEIRDS) working group was chartered by the [IETF](#ietf) to 
standardize RDAP. This working group completed all of its originally chartered goals and was shutdown, as is standard practice in the IETF.

### vCard

vCard is a MIME-encoded standard for exchanging contact information, such as virtual business cards. 
It is specified in [RFC 6530](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6350).
